# Day-Planner

## Description

Created a daily planner to exercise my knowledge of concepts learned so far in bootcamp. Primarily, by using 3rd party API's such as jQuery and Dayjs, we were able to build an app that provides utility and allows for people to effeciently plan their day!.

You will noitce different colors of the day depending on the time of the day. Greyed out portions represent the past, red portions represent the present and green portions represent the future. Fill out the necessary time slots and keep track of your day!
